# Ruby-bubble-sort

This is the first Microverse Ruby project and the requirements are to create two methods: #bubble_sort and #bubble_sort_by

The first one (#bubble_sort) takes an array as an argument and returns a sorted one using the bubble sort method like in this example:

Input: 
<code>
bubble_sort([2, 6, 8, 5, 4, 10, 15, 1])
</code>

Output:
<code>
=> [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15]
</code>

The second one (#bubble_sort_by) takes an array as an argument + a block of code and returns a sorted one using the same method but it depends on the block of code added:

Input:
<code>
bubble_sort_by(["hi", "hello", "hey"]) { |left, right| left.length - right.length }
</code>

Output:
<code>
=> ["hi", "hey", "hello"]
</code>
